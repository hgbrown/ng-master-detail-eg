# Master-Detail Example: Messages

## Introduction

Demonstrates how to implement a master-detail screen combination using a
list of messages as the master view and a single message as the detail view.

## Firebase

The project uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as realtime
database as the back-end to store the messages.

The initial population of the database is stored in: `db-data.ts` and
can be populated with the `npm run populate-db` script included with the
project. This should be run on empty database to avoid duplicate messages.

## Angular CLI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
